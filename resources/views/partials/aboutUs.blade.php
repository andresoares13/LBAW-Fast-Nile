                  To make a Bid it is necessary to have enough funds for the price indicated, which is slightly higher than the value of the previous Bid. You may not Bid if your Bid is already the highest.

                  To create an Auction, go to your profile, then if you are an auctioneer already, you can skip this next step. If you're not an auctioneer, you will have to click on the option to become one and insert your phone number. Now that you are an auctioneer, you may click on the Create Auction option on your profile.

                  Absolutely! By going to your auction page, click on Change Status and then you will have the option to Close Sooner. You may also change the status of your auction to ending to let the bidders know that it is coming to a close sooner than expected.

                  Our policy states that you may only delete your account if you have an auction without bids or if it has bids, then the bids have to be invalid, for example if the users that made them deleted their account. Only then can you delete your account. This prevents auctioneers from listing their cars for sale and canceling when people already started to add funds to Bid.

                <p>
                  You can rate an auctioneer everytime you win an auction of theirs. After rating them, you will have to win another one of their auctions to rate them again. We do this to prevent users from manipulating ratings but also to allow them to change their mind if the second auction they one from an auctioneer went differently than the previous ones.

                  We want people to spend their money responsibly and so we do not allow users to cash out their account. Instead we ask to you are careful and think before adding funds and only add as much as you intend to spend on cars.
